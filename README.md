# vultr-deployer

The purpose of this tool is to ease the management of your instances and allow you to recreate instances in intervals, manage your files and simply save you time.

Your settings are stored in `/assets/settings.json`, so make your way there and fill it up. Once that is done, I do recommend you change the settings of the instance you want to deploy by editing `vultr.py`.

Any suggestions are welcome, feel free to edit it as you wish, as far as it suits your needs.

The program will look for numeric indexing for each folder, starting from zero, so make sure you name your folders accordingly.

-> Each folder is essentially a different server, although you can have many sub-folders within them if you want.
-> For example, if you wanted to deploy 10 instances, the folders should be named 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 9
-> If you have any questions feel free to contact me so I can clear it up for you.
